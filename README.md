# thinice_remake
This is a Game Maker Studio 2 project to recreate the Club Penguin mini game called "Thin Ice."

I created this in my Freshman year of college just for fun. The goal was to recreate it as a stand alone game. 
I created all the objects in the game to function on their own, and most combinations of tiles should be functional.
The project files are all available if  you want to get crazy and create your own levels.
However, I wanted to have a completed solo programming project to show off, so I decided to only remake all the 
original levels instead of adding new ones. There are two zip files included, one with all the project files, and one 
with an executable of the game.

To install:
Game:
  1. Download ThinIce_Game.zip from this github source.
  2. Extract the files to a new folder
  3. Run the file Thin Ice.exe 

Project: 
  1. Download ThinIce_Project.zip from this github source.
  2. Extract the files to a new folder
  3. Open the prj_thinIcev2.yyp in Game Maker Studio 2
  Project Notes:
  **Do not use prj_thinIce.ypp!** Only use prj_thinIcev2.yyp - This is the newest version of the project file, the old one creates strange errors when deleted, however this may no longer be an issue with the newest version of GMS2.
  **Project still worked as of GMS2 version v2023.1.1.62 Runtime v2023.1.1.81**
