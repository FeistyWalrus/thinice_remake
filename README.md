# thinice_remake
This is a Game Maker Studio 2 project to recreate the Club Penguin mini game called "Thin Ice."

I created this in my Freshman year of college just for fun. The goal was to recreate it as a stand alone game, so
that I could add new levels. I created all the objects in the game to function on their own, and most combinations
of levels should be functional. However, I wanted to have a completed solo programming project to show off, so I
decided to only remake all the original levels instead of adding new ones. The project files are all available if 
you want to get crazy and create your own levels. I also included an executable of the game, for anyone who just 
wants to play it.
